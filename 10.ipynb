    "Increasing the number of estimators (weak learners) in the AdaBoost algorithm typically leads to improved performance up to a certain point, after which further increases may have diminishing returns or even degrade performance. Here's how increasing the number of estimators affects the AdaBoost algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Initially, adding more estimators tends to improve the performance of the AdaBoost model. With more weak learners, AdaBoost has more opportunities to correct errors and learn complex patterns in the data. This can lead to better generalization and higher accuracy on both the training and testing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Bias: As the number of estimators increases, the bias of the AdaBoost model decreases. Each weak learner contributes its own decision boundary to the ensemble, allowing the model to capture more nuanced relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Complexity: With more estimators, the AdaBoost model becomes more complex and expressive. It can better fit the training data, potentially capturing intricate patterns and interactions between features. However, this increased complexity may also make the model more susceptible to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small or noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slower Training: Adding more estimators to AdaBoost increases the computational cost of training, as each weak learner needs to be trained sequentially. Training time may become a limiting factor, especially for large datasets or complex weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential for Overfitting: While increasing the number of estimators can improve performance initially, there's a risk of overfitting as the model becomes more complex. If the number of estimators is too high relative to the dataset size or the signal-to-noise ratio is low, AdaBoost may start memorizing the training data rather than learning meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diminishing Returns: At a certain point, adding more estimators may lead to diminishing returns in terms of performance improvement. The model may reach a plateau where further increases in the number of estimators do not significantly enhance performance but incur additional computational costs.\n"
