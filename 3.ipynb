    "Boosting works by sequentially applying a series of weak learners to repeatedly modified versions of the data, producing a series of models that can predict whether an instance will fall into one category or another. A weak learner is defined as a model that is slightly better than random guessing. The essence of boosting is to focus more on instances that are hard to predict, thus gradually improving the model's accuracy with each iteration. The process is detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: The dataset is given equal weights to each instance, emphasizing an equal focus on every data point at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is trained on the dataset.\n",
    "After the first weak learner is trained, the algorithm evaluates its performance by calculating the errors: instances that are misclassified get their weights increased, whereas correctly classified instances have their weights decreased. This means that in the next round, the weak learner will focus more on the instances that were previously misclassified.\n",
    "Error Calculation and Model Weighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each weak learner, an error rate is calculated, which measures how well the learner is performing on the weighted dataset. The error rate often considers the weights of the instances to determine how significant each error is.\n",
    "Based on this error rate, a weight or importance is assigned to the weak learner. Learners with lower error rates are considered more important in the ensemble and are given more weight in the final decision-making process. This weight is used to influence the model's focus in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "Update Weights of Instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of the instances in the training set are updated based on the performance of the model. Instances that were misclassified by the model are given more weight, while the weights for correctly classified instances are decreased. This ensures that the next weak learner focuses more on the instances that the previous model found challenging.\n",
    "Iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2 to 4 are repeated for a specified number of iterations, or until a desired level of accuracy is achieved. With each iteration, the model becomes increasingly focused on the hardest-to-predict instances.\n",
    "Final Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model is an ensemble of all the weak learners, where each learner's vote is weighted based on its accuracy. Predictions are made by aggregating the weighted votes of all the weak learners. Depending on the specific boosting algorithm, this aggregation might involve taking a weighted majority vote (in classification problems) or a weighted sum (in regression problems)."
