    "During the training of AdaBoost, each weak learner is trained to minimize the exponential loss function. The weights of the training instances are adjusted in each iteration to emphasize the instances that are misclassified or have higher errors. This iterative process allows AdaBoost to focus more on the difficult-to-classify instances in subsequent iterations, effectively improving the overall performance of the ensemble model."
