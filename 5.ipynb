    "Boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), typically have several common parameters that control various aspects of the boosting process. Some of the most common parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Estimators (or Trees):\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter specifies the number of weak learners (trees in the case of tree-based boosting algorithms) to be built. Increasing the number of estimators can lead to a more complex model and potentially better performance, but it also increases computational cost and the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "Learning Rate (or Shrinkage):\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final ensemble. A smaller learning rate means that each weak learner has less influence on the final prediction, requiring more weak learners to achieve similar performance. However, a smaller learning rate can sometimes lead to better generalization.\n",
    "Base Estimator:\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms can use different base estimators or weak learners. For example, AdaBoost often uses decision trees with maximum depth of 1 (stumps) as weak learners, while Gradient Boosting Machines typically use decision trees with larger depths. The choice of base estimator can affect the overall performance and computational efficiency of the boosting algorithm.\n",
    "Loss Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function defines the measure of the model's performance that the boosting algorithm tries to optimize during training. Common loss functions include exponential loss for AdaBoost and various types of regression loss functions (e.g., squared loss, absolute loss) for Gradient Boosting Machines. Choosing an appropriate loss function depends on the specific problem and the desired behavior of the model.\n",
    "Subsample Ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some boosting algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Boosting, allow subsampling of the training data at each iteration. The subsample ratio parameter controls the fraction of the training data to be used for fitting the individual weak learners. Subsampling can help improve computational efficiency and reduce overfitting, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "Max Depth (for Tree-based Boosting):\n",
    "\n",
    "In tree-based boosting algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines, the max depth parameter determines the maximum depth of each individual decision tree in the ensemble. Constraining the maximum depth helps prevent overfitting by limiting the complexity of the trees.\n",
    "Regularization Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some boosting algorithms offer regularization parameters to control overfitting. For example, Gradient Boosting Machines provide parameters like min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and max_features, which regulate the minimum number of samples required to split a node, the minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node, and the maximum number of features considered for splitting, respectively."
